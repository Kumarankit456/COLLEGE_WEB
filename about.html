                <h2>Gargi Memorial Institute of Tecnology</h2>
                <h4>(Affiliated to MAKAUT formaly WBUT,Kolkata ,Approved by AICTE,New Delhi)</h4>
                <p>
                    Gargi Memorial Institute of Technology (GMIT), a pioneer in Engineering education, has successfully completed its glorious 11 years.
                     The journey started with a lot of promises in 2011 in the Southern Fringe of Kolkata at Baruipur ,the fruit orchard of Bengal.
                     It is approved by All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and affiliated to Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology
                    (MAKAUT), formerly known as West Bengal University of Technology (WBUT). GMIT currently offers courses in five disciplines namely Computer
                     Science and Engineering (CSE), Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE), Electrical Engineering (EE), Mechanical Engineering (ME) 
                    and Civil Engineering (CE). These five streams hold the line of pedagogy in the institute which had been in high demand right from the
                     beginning all through the 10 years
                    Barely in its 5th year of inception, GMIT started winning accolades and awards. A few to be mentioned are - In 2017, it achieved 8th position
                     as “Best Emerging Engineering College in India” because of its educational excellence and professional infrastructural facilities. 
                     It has been ranked 1st as ‘The Best Emerging Engineering College in West Bengal’ by Times Engineering  4 times in a row in the years 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2020, Zee 24 Ghanta rewarded us with the honor of “Best Emerging and Promising Engineering College Award 2020”.
                    With the Joint venture in 2019 with JIS group (The Biggest Educational Initiative In Eastern India), the college got 
                    best practices support and an organizational experience that JIS group has with it for 25 years which is now leading
                     GMIT towards center of excellence in the years to come. GMIT along with Flemming College of Pharmacy in 2020 and
                      Rhode Island Public School in 2017 running in the same campus, is now an academic hub in South 24 Parganas and has
                       been host to many scholars from the industry-academia and other fields, not to forget the fortune 500 companies
                        which keep coming back every year to pick up the best talents.
                    Apparently, we confide that a good faculty is the pillar of an educational institution, so GMIT has a legacy of top 
                    notch faculties from IIT Kharagpur, IIST, Shibpur, Jadavpur and many more other reputed universities. GMIT believes 
                    in CAMPUS LIFE and ensures holistic development of its students.
